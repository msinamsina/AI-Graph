The code uses FFmpeg for video processing and supports GPU acceleration if available. We'll also download a sample video using `wget` to test the downsampling process.\n",

    "- **VideoDownsamplingStep**: This class, part of the `ai_graph.step.video` module, inherits from `BasePipelineStep` and handles video downsampling. It takes parameters like `output_fps`, `output_resolution`, and `output_format` to specify the target video properties.\n",
    "- **_process_step**: This method checks the input video, retrieves its original FPS using OpenCV, and decides whether downsampling is needed. It constructs the output filename and calls `_downsample_video`.\n",
    "- **_downsample_video**: This method builds and executes an FFmpeg command to perform the downsampling. It supports GPU acceleration (using `h264_nvenc`) if a CUDA-enabled GPU is detected via `torch.cuda.is_available()`. Otherwise, it uses CPU-based encoding (`libx264` for MP4, `libvpx-vp9` for WebM).\n",
    "- **Pipeline**: The `Pipeline` class from `ai_graph.pipeline.base` manages the execution of steps. In this case, it only contains the `VideoDownsamplingStep`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "- Ensure FFmpeg is installed and accessible in your system's PATH.\n",
    "- If you have a CUDA-enabled GPU, the code will attempt to use hardware acceleration, which can significantly speed up processing.\n",
    "- The output video is saved with a `_downsampled` suffix in the same directory as the input video.\n",
    "- If the original FPS matches the target FPS, the downsampling step is skipped to avoid unnecessary processing."
